<h1>Encrypted Code - L0123 Algorithm</h1>

[!INSTALLATION]
    pip install encryptedcode

[!USAGE]
    This package is imported absolutely in your .py files, for example: 'from encryptedcode.encrypted_code import encode', and contains two functions, one for encoding called encode() and another for decoding called decode() using the new L0123 algorithm created by Ing Software Leandro Gonzalez Espinosa

[!IMPORTANT]
    When using this library for the first time on your PC or virtual environment, it will ask you to provide a secret phrase
    You must remember or save this phrase since in order to use the decode function you will need the phrase
    for security reasons for you!!!

[!INFO]
EncryptedCode is a python library accessible to everyone that is under development where I use a new encryption algorithm created by &copy;Leandro Gonzalez Espinosa and named L0123.
